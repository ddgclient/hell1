#SDS Flow/SubFlow is defined 
#
# Configuration File to check Flow based on the TPIE Report File
# It's a simple method for reading the flow without having to parse the entire TPL
# Warning it's not wise to trust TPIE
#
# Format:
# FLOWNAME:
# Followed by Module or SubFlow to search for and identifier [first|last|before|<nothing>]
# removefromcheck - If found remove this module from the Flow to not affect the check
# first - The very first position inthe flow
# last - The very last position in this flow
# rightbefore - Checks that Left Side Module is in the Flow RIGHT AFTER the Right Module
# rightbeforeifexists - Both Modules have to exist but if they exist order is checked
# beforeifexists - Module is before, at any point before, other module in the flow
#     beforeifExists can accept multiple comma seperated modules
# before - Checks that the left side is before the Right side but, doesnt worry about modules between
# <nothing> - Just has to exist in the flow I dont care where
#
# Add more flows as necessary
